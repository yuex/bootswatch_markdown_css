# Pelican Support for Python-Markdown Table Extension

When using a pelican theme based on bootstrap and bootswatch like [iliork](http://github.com/yuex/pelican-iliork), it may be a headache to get the css redecorations generated by python modules get applied to html tags such as `<table>`, `<pre>`, and `<code>`. For `<pre>` and `<code>`, you have to provide your own css files because there's no code highlighting css provided by bootstrap. But for `<table>`, there is css decoration provided by bootstrap and bootswatch. You can write your own css for `<table>`, no problem, but at the loss of elegance and convenience when switching boostrap theme.

So I write this extension for pelican to rewrite the html output of python-markdown tables extension from `<table>` to `<table class="table table-strip...">` to make bootstrap's css.for `<table>` get applied

A neater way is to modify the table extension of python-markdown to make it accept arguments such as `'class=table table-strip...'`. But that will cause trouble in distributing and getting merged by upstream and perhaps also contradict the KISS-style of python-markdown as a markdown parser.
